## v1.0

How to play.
- You should see a blank window and an alert on your screen. Don't worry, it's not a bug, no one knows what you're thinking, nether does Amaka. So, just click 'Ok'
- Next, a prompt will appear on your screen. 
- Press F12 to open your browser console (yeah! this version works in the console. So, follow this repo for the beta version **winks)
- It's time to play! Choose between rock, paper or scissors.
- You get to play 5 rounds. Keep an eye on your console for the outcome of the each round
- Now that the game is over, it's settled! Be a man and give her the money if you lost. Other wise DON'T! You should learn to be wicked more often. lol
